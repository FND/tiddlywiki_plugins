Jul 17 08:18:16 *	Now talking on #tiddlywiki
Jul 17 08:18:16 *	Topic for #tiddlywiki is: Welcome to the unofficial TiddlyWiki channel. || http://www.tiddlywiki.com || http://www.tiddlywiki.org
Jul 17 08:18:16 *	Topic for #tiddlywiki set by Ace_NoOne at Thu Jul 05 21:49:30 2007
Jul 17 08:18:16 *	services. sets mode +e Ace_NoOne
Jul 17 08:18:16 *	services. sets mode +6 Ace_NoOne
Jul 17 08:18:40 <Ace_NoOne>	hey fellas
Jul 17 08:18:55 <Ace_NoOne>	DanielBaird: I've made quite some progress on the skin
Jul 17 08:22:07 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq: in "[tw] Locking tiddlers", David Shaw says "[even while allowing users to add and edit content,] I want to have the original information locked so that it's still there and available for reference."
Jul 17 08:22:07 <Ace_NoOne>	first I was thinking "use shadow tiddlers, giving you a very simplified revision control" - but there's no user-friendly way for that, really
Jul 17 08:22:07 <Ace_NoOne>	so could the drafts from your auto-save plugin be used for keeping the original version intact?
Jul 17 08:23:38 <DanielBaird>	that's a nice idea.  i think there'd be some interesting output from a draft/shadow/versioning design session 
Jul 17 08:24:56 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 17 08:25:12 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: http://www.tiddlywiki.org/tmp/TW4MW.html
Jul 17 08:25:44 <Ace_NoOne>	that's the static version; hoping to finish the PHP implementation today
Jul 17 08:26:21 <DanielBaird>	that's pretty awesome
Jul 17 08:26:45 <Ace_NoOne>	O_o
Jul 17 08:26:55 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks
Jul 17 08:27:06 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq gave me quite a bit of advice and constructive criticism
Jul 17 08:27:25 <DanielBaird>	it's so hard to do a mw skin, there are hardly any out there
Jul 17 08:27:30 <Ace_NoOne>	actually
Jul 17 08:27:38 <Ace_NoOne>	it's not so hard once you understand the structure
Jul 17 08:27:40 <DanielBaird>	so if we have one, that puts us in the top 5% of mw sites :)
Jul 17 08:27:43 <Ace_NoOne>	it's just the damn MonoBook skin
Jul 17 08:27:49 <Ace_NoOne>	heh that's what I thought
Jul 17 08:27:52 <Ace_NoOne>	makes us stand out
Jul 17 08:27:54 <DanielBaird>	yeah 
Jul 17 08:28:20 <Ace_NoOne>	I've put *A LOT* of work into understanding and refining the default MonoBook skin, to understand the layout
Jul 17 08:28:41 <Ace_NoOne>	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning <-- I did that for my own reference
Jul 17 08:29:12 <Ace_NoOne>	now, during the actual implementation, I try to further improve readability (mixing PHP and HTML can be hard on the eyes)
Jul 17 08:29:47 <Ace_NoOne>	but when that's done, it's really just a matter of placing the respective modules
Jul 17 08:30:43 <DanielBaird>	brb
Jul 17 08:33:05 <Ace_NoOne>	ditto
Jul 17 09:14:24 <Ace_NoOne>	Daniel: which of these logos do you think would work best for the new skin: http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/TiddlyWikiDotOrgLogos
Jul 17 09:18:18 <DanielBaird>	goota run.. a lot of those logos are nice
Jul 17 09:18:42 <Ace_NoOne>	ok have fun
Jul 17 09:19:08 <DanielBaird>	do we want to have a separate branding for the wiki, apart from tw itself?
Jul 17 09:19:15 <DanielBaird>	anyway gotta run..see you
Jul 17 09:19:19 <Ace_NoOne>	see you
Jul 17 09:19:23 *	DanielBaird has quit ("Leaving.")
Jul 17 10:07:19 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq: when trying to sync the crypto plugin, I get an error "Error: me.adaptor.putTiddler is not a function"
Jul 17 10:35:22 *	dachary has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 17 11:13:27 *	dachary has joined #tiddlywiki
Jul 17 12:14:21 <Saq__>	Ace_NoOne, you remember what I said about crypto?
Jul 17 12:50:47 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq: yes
Jul 17 14:17:50 <Saq__>	Ace_NoOne, wait, the crypto plugin?
Jul 17 14:18:00 <Saq__>	the one you guys are gushing about?
Jul 17 14:18:05 <Ace_NoOne>	TiddlerEncryptionPlugin was too long to type :P
Jul 17 14:18:06 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 17 14:18:40 <Saq__>	thats a strange error... I have actually never tried the sync stuff... did you do some firebug snooping?
Jul 17 14:19:40 <Ace_NoOne>	not really; I'm a bit busy today
Jul 17 14:19:47 <Ace_NoOne>	my dad crashed his computer, again
Jul 17 14:19:57 <Saq__>	LOL
Jul 17 14:20:00 <Ace_NoOne>	for like the 6th time in 2 years
Jul 17 14:20:06 <Saq__>	Please tell me you use some kind of backup system
Jul 17 14:20:08 <Ace_NoOne>	not software, but hardware it seems
Jul 17 14:20:14 <Saq__>	ah
Jul 17 14:20:19 <Ace_NoOne>	well, an external HDD
Jul 17 14:20:30 <Saq__>	that sucks... never fun to troubleshoot
Jul 17 14:20:30 <Saq__>	oooh
Jul 17 14:20:33 <Ace_NoOne>	this is the 4th computer he's had in 2 years
Jul 17 14:20:35 <Saq__>	I lost 300gb of data that way a few years ago
Jul 17 14:20:39 <Ace_NoOne>	D: !!
Jul 17 14:20:41 <Saq__>	what are the symptoms?
Jul 17 14:21:02 <Ace_NoOne>	Windows not starting anymore
Jul 17 14:21:07 <Ace_NoOne>	I'll go over there in a few minutes
Jul 17 14:21:11 <Saq__>	from the external?
Jul 17 14:21:16 <Saq__>	does he boot from it?
Jul 17 14:21:16 <Ace_NoOne>	external = data only
Jul 17 14:21:24 <Saq__>	then has he tried unplugging it?
Jul 17 14:21:31 <Ace_NoOne>	it's always unplugged
Jul 17 14:21:48 <Saq__>	i mean the external hdd
Jul 17 14:21:53 <Ace_NoOne>	yes
Jul 17 14:22:01 <Ace_NoOne>	it's just plugged in when needed
Jul 17 14:22:09 <Saq__>	well if its unplugged  dont see how it can be at fault....
Jul 17 14:22:15 <Ace_NoOne>	I never said it was
Jul 17 14:22:16 <Ace_NoOne>	the PC is
Jul 17 14:22:38 <Saq__>	nevermind... I need this cup of tea more than I had realized :)
Jul 17 14:22:54 <Ace_NoOne>	lol
Jul 17 14:23:06 <Saq__>	Re: logos.... stick with the current one
Jul 17 14:23:10 <Saq__>	its the best of the bunch
Jul 17 14:23:29 <Ace_NoOne>	probably
Jul 17 14:23:41 <Ace_NoOne>	there must be something in the air at his place - the first PC, about 18 months ago (a few weeks after the purchase), had a bad Motherboard, that got exchanged, then the RAM went bad - so he got sick of it and took it back, got a refund
Jul 17 14:23:47 <Ace_NoOne>	bought a new one, similar story
Jul 17 14:23:53 <Ace_NoOne>	(different model!)
Jul 17 14:23:58 <Ace_NoOne>	third one, again
Jul 17 14:24:07 <Ace_NoOne>	this fourth one has been running nicely for some time now tho
Jul 17 14:24:11 <Ace_NoOne>	I'm sick of it
Jul 17 14:24:14 <Saq__>	crazy.....
Jul 17 14:24:24 <Ace_NoOne>	indeed
Jul 17 14:24:29 <Saq__>	but if all you know is that windows wont start id start off by thinking it was a software problem
Jul 17 14:24:35 <Saq__>	take along a few boot disks
Jul 17 14:24:42 <Saq__>	recovery environs/knoppix
Jul 17 14:24:47 <Ace_NoOne>	definitely
Jul 17 14:25:04 <Saq__>	I use Norton Ghost...... takes me five minutes to restore the system
Jul 17 14:25:07 <Ace_NoOne>	I haven't checked this one yet, but just from experience, I'm afraid it's gonna be hardware again
Jul 17 14:25:13 <Saq__>	hehe
Jul 17 14:33:35 <Saq__>	dachary, I will dedicate some time to r4tw tomorrowi
Jul 17 14:33:46 <Saq__>	ill start by adding your patches to the svn repo
Jul 17 14:33:57 <Saq__>	and then ill clean up my methods and post them
Jul 17 14:34:23 <Saq__>	I have never written unit tests before.... but I might try to for my methods.
Jul 17 14:35:57 <Saq__>	I actually need to write some new methods....... for the new build of LewcidTW. Adding plugins with compression.
Jul 17 14:40:03 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq, quick question: I haven't started yet, but out of curiosity, could I make a private SVN sub-folder
Jul 17 14:40:28 <Saq__>	not that I know.... but we could always setup a second svn
Jul 17 14:40:43 <Saq__>	its probably possible just not easy
Jul 17 14:40:46 <Ace_NoOne>	that's alright, I was just curiosity
Jul 17 14:40:50 <Ace_NoOne>	*it
Jul 17 14:40:59 <Saq__>	my skills are setting up svn is limited to using the dreamhost control panel
Jul 17 14:41:12 <Saq__>	we could use fnd.lewcid.org/svnpriv
Jul 17 14:41:16 <Saq__>	something like that
Jul 17 14:41:28 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe - maybe a .htaccess in /svn/private?
Jul 17 14:41:34 <Saq__>	fndsvn.lewcid.org
Jul 17 14:41:43 <Saq__>	well.... i think svn works on a webdav like protocol
Jul 17 14:41:46 <Saq__>	so that might not work
Jul 17 14:41:51 <dachary>	yop
Jul 17 14:41:55 <Ace_NoOne>	doesn't apache handle that too?
Jul 17 14:42:01 <dachary>	i'm busy right now (in the middle of a migration)
Jul 17 14:42:10 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: [twdev] Friendlier toolbar customization - you just need to say "I like the idea - go for it!"
Jul 17 14:42:26 <Saq__>	we could try... im not even sure how to login to fnd.lewcid.org/svn via shell
Jul 17 14:42:35 <Saq__>	btw
Jul 17 14:42:38 <Saq__>	since you havent started.
Jul 17 14:42:45 <Saq__>	we could use svn.fnd.lewcid.org
Jul 17 14:42:47 <Saq__>	if you prefer that
Jul 17 14:42:50 <Ace_NoOne>	not really
Jul 17 14:42:57 <Saq__>	alrighty
Jul 17 14:43:01 <Ace_NoOne>	but thanks :)
Jul 17 14:43:11 <Saq__>	you've got shell access so you can fiddle with the htaccess
Jul 17 14:43:27 <Ace_NoOne>	I need to login and see what I can do at all
Jul 17 14:43:27 <Saq__>	if you want to setup a second svn just let me know
Jul 17 14:43:32 <Ace_NoOne>	sure, thanks
Jul 17 14:43:35 <Saq__>	I do understand the need.......
Jul 17 14:43:47 <Saq__>	plugins that are ready and those that are not for instance
Jul 17 14:43:52 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 17 14:44:03 <Ace_NoOne>	but I might as well create a draft folder
Jul 17 14:44:11 <Ace_NoOne>	I don't even know how to start on anything there yet
Jul 17 14:44:20 <Saq__>	yup... im going with a sandbox folder
Jul 17 14:44:42 <Ace_NoOne>	wait
Jul 17 14:44:50 <Ace_NoOne>	there is a FND.access file in ~/SVN
Jul 17 14:45:05 <Ace_NoOne>	I might be able to copy that into a .../private folder
Jul 17 14:45:10 <Saq__>	thats for your login.
Jul 17 14:45:19 <Ace_NoOne>	it says "* = r"
Jul 17 14:45:23 <Saq__>	if you want to make a private folder
Jul 17 14:45:38 <Saq__>	you probably need to tweak either the access file or the hooks
Jul 17 14:45:38 <Ace_NoOne>	I'll just ask in #SVN later tonight
Jul 17 14:45:42 <Saq__>	yup
Jul 17 14:45:59 <Saq__>	the hooks is probably where.... thats how you can do complex authorization stuff based on folders
Jul 17 14:46:06 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 17 14:46:13 <Saq__>	so give certain users access to certain folders and not others
Jul 17 14:46:23 <Ace_NoOne>	I gotta head out, to my dad's - you don't forget to encourage Xavier
Jul 17 14:46:30 <Ace_NoOne>	;)
Jul 17 14:46:34 <Saq__>	:)
Jul 17 14:46:38 <Saq__>	Later man, good luck!
Jul 17 14:46:39 <Ace_NoOne>	cya
Jul 17 14:46:41 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks gee

Jul 18 09:08:46 <DanielBaird>	so awesome
Jul 18 09:10:07 <Ace_NoOne>	I'll never touch PHP again tho lol
Jul 18 09:10:53 <Ace_NoOne>	also, I'm considering modifying the colors a bit - like, based on this: http://www.216colors.com/colors.shtml ... but I suck at color selection
Jul 18 09:18:15 <Ace_NoOne>	what I like about the skin: on the one hand, it doesn't look like MediaWiki at all anymore - but it's still familiar enough (I hope) for user to jump right in
Jul 18 09:32:16 <Saq__>	There needs to be a turtle in the logo. Would fit in with the colour... somehow!
Jul 18 09:32:23 <Ace_NoOne>	a turtle?
Jul 18 09:32:32 <Saq__>	A turtle
Jul 18 09:32:34 <Saq__>	aqua
Jul 18 09:32:48 <Saq__>	The bumpy bits in the w. Turtles.
Jul 18 09:32:56 *	Ace_NoOne is confused

Jul 18 09:36:26 <Saq__>	I missed that before.... sorry about that.
Jul 18 09:36:30 <Ace_NoOne>	no worries
Jul 18 09:36:46 <Saq__>	Hehe. Is that Daniel's influence or mine?
Jul 18 09:36:47 <Ace_NoOne>	you said JR was on vacation? I want his okay before this goes live...
Jul 18 09:36:55 <Ace_NoOne>	sorry what?
Jul 18 09:36:59 <Saq__>	Its the first Oz'ism you pick up.

Jul 18 09:37:22 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe
Jul 18 09:37:31 <Saq__>	Yes JR mentioned he was going on vacation for a week. The same day he was committing those changes to svn
Jul 18 09:37:46 <Ace_NoOne>	which means he'll be back on Monday or so?
Jul 18 09:37:51 <Ace_NoOne>	where did he mention it? privately?
Jul 18 09:37:55 <Saq__>	I reckon so.
Jul 18 09:38:16 <Saq__>	Yes in an email..... saying he would try to get to the popup code before he left but might not be able to.
Jul 18 09:38:21 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe
Jul 18 09:38:25 <Ace_NoOne>	keep bugging him
Jul 18 09:38:33 <Ace_NoOne>	send mails to his blackberry lol

Jul 18 09:38:59 <Saq__>	the waves in the w
Jul 18 09:39:02 <Ace_NoOne>	yes
Jul 18 09:39:04 <Saq__>	a caterpillar
Jul 18 09:39:28 <Ace_NoOne>	well ... what about it? not exactly sure what you're getting at
Jul 18 09:39:52 <Saq__>	For some reason I feel it should represent an animal/insect.
Jul 18 09:40:06 <Saq__>	Like an April's fools version of the logo
Jul 18 09:40:12 <Ace_NoOne>	hah
Jul 18 09:40:16 <Ace_NoOne>	that's not too bad an idea, actually
Jul 18 09:40:20 <Saq__>	I love what Google does with their search logos on the various holidays
Jul 18 09:40:32 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah - but they got $$$
Jul 18 09:40:41 <Saq__>	bah
Jul 18 09:40:47 <Ace_NoOne>	... and visitors too ... ... ...
Jul 18 09:40:47 <Saq__>	Your OCD trumps that any day
Jul 18 09:40:52 <Saq__>	Look at what you have accomplished
Jul 18 09:41:03 <Saq__>	actually... what are the stats on the wiki? and on trac?
Jul 18 09:41:07 <Ace_NoOne>	what? wasting a week of study time you mean?
Jul 18 09:41:10 <Saq__>	how many unique daily visitors?
Jul 18 09:41:10 <Ace_NoOne>	no idea
Jul 18 09:41:15 <Ace_NoOne>	wait
Jul 18 09:41:29 <Saq__>	Ah.. I thought you might know being Mr.Admin Man.

Jul 18 09:42:24 <Saq__>	Nice
Jul 18 09:42:34 <Ace_NoOne>	stumbled across that for the TiddlySpy thread
Jul 18 09:42:43 <Ace_NoOne>	when the JS was left in the bare TW
Jul 18 09:43:02 <Ace_NoOne>	not sure how to use this tho
Jul 18 09:43:45 <Saq__>	Since you are the official help bot... here are some interesting URL's:
Jul 18 09:43:46 <Saq__>	http://wikitaller.wikispaces.com/twiki
Jul 18 09:44:07 <Ace_NoOne>	that's en espanol D:
Jul 18 09:44:12 <Saq__>	Yup
Jul 18 09:44:15 <Saq__>	But seems handy
Jul 18 09:44:23 <Saq__>	Thought someone should post it to the grou;
Jul 18 09:44:30 <Saq__>	group
Jul 18 09:44:37 <Saq__>	http://www.ericsprojects.com/?p=100
Jul 18 09:44:39 <Ace_NoOne>	bad choice of a subdir btw; TWiki is a fully-featured wiki engine
Jul 18 09:45:01 <Saq__>	Yup
Jul 18 09:45:07 <Saq__>	Last one: http://bamboostrips.blogspot.com/2007/06/browser-hopping.html
Jul 18 09:45:28 <Ace_NoOne>	I'll post those links to the group, if you fire off a quick response to Xavier ;P
Jul 18 09:45:57 <Ace_NoOne>	how did you come across those? trackback to tiddlythemes or so?
Jul 18 09:47:56 <Saq__>	Done
Jul 18 09:48:01 <Saq__>	Ace_NoOne, yup
Jul 18 09:48:06 <Saq__>	Yahoo's Site Explorer
Jul 18 09:50:29 <Ace_NoOne>	what's that
Jul 18 09:50:31 <Ace_NoOne>	never tried it
Jul 18 09:50:53 <Saq__>	A fancy name for searching for sites that link to a given URL
Jul 18 09:50:54 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks for that ^^ :)
Jul 18 09:50:58 <Ace_NoOne>	hah ok
Jul 18 09:51:03 <Saq__>	came across it by accident yesterday
Jul 18 09:52:13 <Ace_NoOne>	might be useful
Jul 18 09:52:16 <Ace_NoOne>	I'll bookmark it
Jul 18 09:52:42 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: you know what my major pain is with PHP?
Jul 18 09:52:50 <Saq__>	hmm?
Jul 18 09:53:16 <Ace_NoOne>	I can EITHER a) have nicely-indented PHP code OR b) properly indented HTML output - but NOT BOTH
Jul 18 09:53:18 <Ace_NoOne>	it's killing me
Jul 18 09:53:32 <Saq__>	really?
Jul 18 09:53:35 <Saq__>	Odd.
Jul 18 09:53:45 <Ace_NoOne>	not really - it makes sense if you look at it
Jul 18 09:53:45 <Saq__>	Isnt there a php extension for prettifying the code?
Jul 18 09:53:49 <Ace_NoOne>	with all the foreach and stuff
Jul 18 09:53:52 <Ace_NoOne>	how so?
Jul 18 09:54:18 <Saq__>	Can't remember to be honest. You might want to google it
Jul 18 09:54:19 <Ace_NoOne>	I could run tidy before serving a page - but that'd be a performance issue I guess
Jul 18 09:54:29 <Saq__>	could you run tidy and save it?
Jul 18 09:54:35 <Ace_NoOne>	no idea
Jul 18 10:00:27 <Saq__>	I still dont like the front page
Jul 18 10:00:38 <Ace_NoOne>	me neither
Jul 18 10:00:42 <Ace_NoOne>	I haven't worked on it tho
Jul 18 10:00:51 <Ace_NoOne>	been working on this skin, obvioiusly
Jul 18 10:00:55 <Ace_NoOne>	*obviously
Jul 18 10:00:55 <Saq__>	ignore the know-it-alls
Jul 18 10:01:07 <Saq__>	its just far too busy
Jul 18 10:01:11 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, I will - there hasn't been *any* activity on the wiki or list for a week or more
Jul 18 10:01:24 <Ace_NoOne>	which kinda pisses me off
Jul 18 10:01:33 <Saq__>	that might be a good thing though
Jul 18 10:01:39 <Saq__>	Less interference
Jul 18 10:01:48 <Ace_NoOne>	well, as I've said before: I can't do it alone
Jul 18 10:02:03 <Ace_NoOne>	not even if I was a full-time BT Osmosoft employee
Jul 18 10:02:14 <Saq__>	It will be easier once the layout stuff is don
Jul 18 10:02:15 <Ace_NoOne>	well, then, maybe, over a couple of months or so
Jul 18 10:02:20 <Saq__>	Fred dont stress over this
Jul 18 10:02:31 <Saq__>	do what you can for as long as its fun
Jul 18 10:02:33 <Ace_NoOne>	I don't, but it still pisses me off somehow
Jul 18 10:02:49 <Saq__>	I get burnt out by TW and then vanish for a few weeks.
Jul 18 10:02:51 <Ace_NoOne>	I add bits and pieces when I come across them (like your preloading tip the other day)
Jul 18 10:03:13 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, figures
Jul 18 10:03:38 <Saq__>	I can add content if you can lock it so no one else fiddles with it
Jul 18 10:03:52 <Saq__>	Im a perfectionist and ill throw a fit if someone messes it up ;)
Jul 18 10:04:12 <Ace_NoOne>	lol
Jul 18 10:04:19 <Saq__>	How do you add an extra Tip of the Week?
Jul 18 10:04:25 <Ace_NoOne>	hold on
Jul 18 10:04:28 <Saq__>	Have you seen the user guides for TiddlySnip?
Jul 18 10:04:34 <Ace_NoOne>	nope
Jul 18 10:04:40 <Ace_NoOne>	not lately at least
Jul 18 10:04:55 <Saq__>	http://tiddlysnip.com/#%5B%5BUser%20Guides%5D%5D
Jul 18 10:04:58 <Saq__>	try the second one
Jul 18 10:05:01 <Ace_NoOne>	http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_Week
Jul 18 10:05:07 <Saq__>	Configuration Guide
Jul 18 10:05:25 <Ace_NoOne>	nice logo and layout btw
Jul 18 10:05:44 <Saq__>	Thanks... logo is Daniel
Jul 18 10:06:35 <Ace_NoOne>	"The End." hah
Jul 18 10:07:00 <Saq__>	I would like to think that is a terrific Guide....
Jul 18 10:07:09 <Ace_NoOne>	it looks pretty damn good
Jul 18 10:07:16 <Saq__>	its the kind of effort I would put into the docs... so if someone messed with it...
Jul 18 10:07:22 <Ace_NoOne>	I hate having to make screenshots...
Jul 18 10:07:23 <Saq__>	Lord have mercy on them because I wont
Jul 18 10:07:30 <Saq__>	yeah its never fun but it helps!
Jul 18 10:07:36 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 18 10:07:40 <Ace_NoOne>	well, that's where the edit wars come in:
Jul 18 10:07:59 <Ace_NoOne>	you create your stuff, if someone messes with it to your disliking, you can just revert the change
Jul 18 10:08:11 <Ace_NoOne>	but you might be thankful for fixed typos and stuff
Jul 18 10:08:19 <Saq__>	Spell check to the rescue
Jul 18 10:08:28 <Ace_NoOne>	it was an example duh ;P
Jul 18 10:08:46 <Ace_NoOne>	so that's not really a big issue there, IMO
Jul 18 10:08:55 <Ace_NoOne>	but
Jul 18 10:08:57 <Ace_NoOne>	nevertheless
Jul 18 10:09:01 <Ace_NoOne>	you can protect pages
Jul 18 10:09:06 <Ace_NoOne>	so only sysops can change them
Jul 18 10:09:18 <Ace_NoOne>	(like the main page on WP=
Jul 18 10:09:23 <Ace_NoOne>	s/=/)/#
Jul 18 10:09:26 <Ace_NoOne>	oh ffs
Jul 18 10:09:27 <Ace_NoOne>	damn keyboard
Jul 18 10:09:41 <Saq__>	Yeah but everyone will throw a fit if you protect all my pages
Jul 18 10:09:50 <Ace_NoOne>	fuck them :P
Jul 18 10:10:02 <Ace_NoOne>	and
Jul 18 10:10:09 <Saq__>	The tip of the week.....
Jul 18 10:10:13 <Ace_NoOne>	as long as they're comprehensive, that should be okay
Jul 18 10:10:20 <Saq__>	you cant have many and have it switch between them?
Jul 18 10:10:36 <Ace_NoOne>	you can, but I couldn't be bothered installing the required extensions for that yet
Jul 18 10:10:46 <Saq__>	Hehe :)
Jul 18 10:10:59 <Ace_NoOne>	http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RandomInclude
Jul 18 10:11:31 <Ace_NoOne>	want me to install that?
Jul 18 10:11:38 <Saq__>	If you could
Jul 18 10:11:45 <Saq__>	I wanted to put the IRC account in there
Jul 18 10:11:52 <Saq__>	channel, sorry
Jul 18 10:11:56 <Ace_NoOne>	ohh good idea
Jul 18 10:13:49 <Saq__>	I need a suggestion for a name for a plugin
Jul 18 10:13:55 <Ace_NoOne>	sure 
Jul 18 10:14:01 <Ace_NoOne>	D: I still haven't tried your plugin goddamnit
Jul 18 10:14:03 <Saq__>	it lets you use Control + S to trigger  a save in TiddlyWiki
Jul 18 10:14:06 <Saq__>	lol
Jul 18 10:14:23 <Ace_NoOne>	so CTRL+S instead of ALT+[SHIFT+]S?
Jul 18 10:14:36 <Ace_NoOne>	QuickSavePlugin?
Jul 18 10:14:55 <Saq__>	Not KeyboardSavingPlugin? I suck at names
Jul 18 10:15:19 <Ace_NoOne>	well, keyboard saving is already in there
Jul 18 10:15:25 <Ace_NoOne>	with the default access keys
Jul 18 10:15:28 <Ace_NoOne>	TotW updated; will install the extension now
Jul 18 10:15:38 <Saq__>	Thanks!
Jul 18 10:19:03 <Ace_NoOne>	done: http://www.tiddlywiki.org/wiki/Special:Version
Jul 18 10:19:25 <Ace_NoOne>	now you just need to create the page(s?) as described in the extension's usage examples
Jul 18 10:19:29 <Ace_NoOne>	I haven't looked into that yet
Jul 18 10:19:33 <Saq__>	Splendid!
Jul 18 10:20:08 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: you can have wiki syntax highlighting if you want
Jul 18 10:20:30 <Saq__>	I am not keen on highlighting..
Jul 18 10:20:37 <Ace_NoOne>	ok
Jul 18 10:20:49 <Ace_NoOne>	I'm just trying it myself; not sure if I'll keep it
Jul 18 10:23:48 *	dachary has joined #tiddlywiki
Jul 18 10:23:55 <Ace_NoOne>	hey dachary 
Jul 18 10:24:07 <Saq__>	dachary, Good morning.
Jul 18 10:25:58 <Ace_NoOne>	btw Saq: that extension does not explicitly state whether it works with MW 1.10 - it probably does, but let me know if you encounter any issues
Jul 18 10:26:29 <Saq__>	Will do
Jul 18 10:27:23 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: your NewSavedTiddler.js shrunk by 50% with the second posting - but you just said "Updated to warn if overwriting a tiddler."!?
Jul 18 10:27:43 <Saq__>	It shrunk? Huh
Jul 18 10:27:49 <Ace_NoOne>	well, hold on
Jul 18 10:28:04 <Ace_NoOne>	duh I'm stupid
Jul 18 10:28:13 <Saq__>	lol
Jul 18 10:28:22 <Ace_NoOne>	I looked at TB's size column - ignoring the fact that your first mail had all that text in it...
Jul 18 10:28:36 <Saq__>	ah!
Jul 18 10:28:42 <Ace_NoOne>	silly
Jul 18 10:31:08 <Saq__>	I've actually needed a macro like that myself sometimes so its handy
Jul 18 10:31:20 <Ace_NoOne>	you were pretty quick with it
Jul 18 10:31:43 <Saq__>	It's quite simple code.. and I had written similar stuff for different projects before
Jul 18 10:31:54 <Ace_NoOne>	I haven't really grasped what he wants (I stop reading when I spot certain plugins being mentioned, to pretect myself)
Jul 18 10:32:05 <Saq__>	LOL
Jul 18 10:32:12 <Ace_NoOne>	I'm quite serious
Jul 18 10:32:21 <Saq__>	It creates a new tiddler with predefined text, tags etc, prompts for a title
Jul 18 10:32:32 <Saq__>	the difference is the tiddler is saved and displayed in the ViewTemplate
Jul 18 10:32:41 <Ace_NoOne>	isn't that preloading as I told him?
Jul 18 10:32:49 <Saq__>	Not unsaved and in the EditTemplate like with the regular NewTiddler macro
Jul 18 10:32:51 <Saq__>	well no
Jul 18 10:33:00 <Ace_NoOne>	ohhh 
Jul 18 10:33:01 <Ace_NoOne>	I see
Jul 18 10:33:14 <Saq__>	Its nice if the end user is not supposed to see the editing stuff
Jul 18 10:33:16 <Ace_NoOne>	sorry, didn't pay attention to VIEWTemplate
Jul 18 10:33:17 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 18 10:33:19 <Saq__>	present a niceer GUI
Jul 18 10:33:33 <Ace_NoOne>	I might use that for my data vault...
Jul 18 10:33:35 <Ace_NoOne>	ACK! SEEE!!!
Jul 18 10:33:40 <Saq__>	lol
Jul 18 10:33:52 <Ace_NoOne>	nah, I'm good with ASCII editing 
Jul 18 10:34:00 <Ace_NoOne>	anything else means clicking
Jul 18 10:44:06 <dachary>	hello
Jul 18 10:44:27 <Ace_NoOne>	good morning dachary 
Jul 18 10:51:34 <Ace_NoOne>	I gotta run some errands - bbs

Jul 18 19:41:57 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq: Can I disable double-click editing somehow? Or better, make that triple-click?
Jul 18 19:47:41 <Saq>	Ace_NoOne,dinner..... but first, explain why
Jul 18 19:47:55 <Ace_NoOne>	ack
Jul 18 19:47:57 <Ace_NoOne>	one sec too late :D
Jul 18 19:48:04 <Ace_NoOne>	well, double-clicking already select the line/paragraph
Jul 18 19:48:21 <Ace_NoOne>	and I use that quite often - only to find myself going into edit mode
Jul 18 19:50:21 <Saq>	Story.prototype.onTiddlerDblClick = function(e){ return false;}
Jul 18 19:50:39 <Ace_NoOne>	that's disabling - good
Jul 18 19:50:48 <Saq>	that will work in edit mode as well....
Jul 18 19:50:50 <Saq>	if you dont want it to
Jul 18 19:50:57 <Saq>	look at the original function and tweak it
Jul 18 19:50:59 <Ace_NoOne>	yup
Jul 18 19:51:03 <Saq>	Have fun!
Jul 18 19:51:05 <Saq>	later
Jul 18 19:51:07 <Ace_NoOne>	maybe I can find out how to put another click check in there, to make the triple click
Jul 18 19:51:07 <Ace_NoOne>	later
Jul 18 19:51:16 <Saq>	btw, there is no triple click event
Jul 18 19:51:22 <Ace_NoOne>	I know
Jul 18 19:51:25 *	akollegger_ has quit ()
Jul 18 19:51:25 <Ace_NoOne>	but I might construct one
Jul 18 19:51:30 <Ace_NoOne>	dblclick + single click
Jul 18 19:51:31 <Saq>	JavaScript has a click event and dblclick
Jul 18 19:51:33 <Saq>	later mate
Jul 18 19:51:35 <Ace_NoOne>	later
Jul 18 21:26:06 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq: got it working (not in TW yet tho)
Jul 18 21:26:27 <Saq>	triple click?
Jul 18 21:26:31 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 18 21:26:32 <Ace_NoOne>	but
Jul 18 21:26:34 <Saq>	Is there really a need?
Jul 18 21:26:41 <Ace_NoOne>	I would love to have it
Jul 18 21:26:46 <Saq>	why not just control + dblclick
Jul 18 21:26:53 <Ace_NoOne>	hassle
Jul 18 21:26:59 <Saq>	bah
Jul 18 21:27:03 <Saq>	Let's see the code.
Jul 18 21:27:08 <Ace_NoOne>	hold on
Jul 18 21:28:03 <Ace_NoOne>	http://paste.css-standards.org/19771/view
Jul 18 21:28:25 <Ace_NoOne>	but: I'm currently using a hardcoded interval value - what if someone has increased his system's dblclick interval
Jul 18 21:28:56 <Saq>	the way I see it you are the only one crazy enough to use it... so it doesnt matter
Jul 18 21:29:07 <Ace_NoOne>	it does matter to me
Jul 18 21:29:12 <Ace_NoOne>	universality++
Jul 18 21:29:39 <Ace_NoOne>	I'm thinking of making two dblclicks maybe
Jul 18 21:29:51 <Saq>	There is another flaw
Jul 18 21:29:51 <Ace_NoOne>	but ... D:
Jul 18 21:29:53 <Ace_NoOne>	yes?
Jul 18 21:30:02 <Saq>	You need to nullify the dblclick.
Jul 18 21:30:07 <Saq>	The second click will trigger it
Jul 18 21:30:28 <Ace_NoOne>	but then the whole thing stops working?
Jul 18 21:30:33 <Ace_NoOne>	ohh no nvm
Jul 18 21:30:49 <Ace_NoOne>	there is no dblclick event used!?
Jul 18 21:31:05 <Saq>	But there might be. You need to account for that
Jul 18 21:31:15 <Saq>	Your onlick needs to do the cancelBubble stuff
Jul 18 21:31:48 <Ace_NoOne>	so ... what now?
Jul 18 21:32:12 <Saq>	Pardon?
Jul 18 21:32:24 <Ace_NoOne>	just this.dblclick = null; ?
Jul 18 21:32:41 <Saq>	No no.
Jul 18 21:32:44 <Saq>	The onclick
Jul 18 21:32:44 <Ace_NoOne>	if clickCount === 2
Jul 18 21:32:49 <Saq>	bring in e as an argument
Jul 18 21:33:05 <Saq>	then if(!e) e = window.event
Jul 18 21:33:11 <Saq>	e.cancelBubble
Jul 18 21:33:26 <Saq>	if (e.stopPropagation) e.stopPropagation()
Jul 18 21:33:34 <Saq>	look at one of the onclicks in the TW core
Jul 18 21:33:54 <Ace_NoOne>	ok will do - thanks
Jul 18 21:34:00 <Ace_NoOne>	btw, just installed your CGP
Jul 18 21:34:03 <Ace_NoOne>	(nice name btw)
Jul 18 21:34:11 <Saq>	Thanks! I usually suck at names
Jul 18 21:34:18 <Ace_NoOne>	I like this one
Jul 18 21:34:25 <Saq>	Simpler
Jul 18 21:34:32 <Saq>	More transparent to the end user.
Jul 18 21:34:39 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 18 21:35:04 <Saq>	The limitation is it cant save the tiddler you are editing if it doesnt exist.
Jul 18 21:35:17 <Ace_NoOne>	why's that
Jul 18 21:35:23 <Ace_NoOne>	ooh
Jul 18 21:35:26 <Ace_NoOne>	because of the extended fields
Jul 18 21:35:29 <Saq>	yup
Jul 18 21:35:42 <Ace_NoOne>	well ...
Jul 18 21:35:45 <Ace_NoOne>	honestly?
Jul 18 21:35:48 <Saq>	Ergo, save the damned thing first.
Jul 18 21:35:53 <Ace_NoOne>	that might be a problem
Jul 18 21:36:06 <Ace_NoOne>	because people will rely on this thing, and save it even less
Jul 18 21:36:21 <Saq>	I was thinking of throwing in a warning.
Jul 18 21:36:36 <Saq>	That the tiddler wont be saved, unless they save it first.
Jul 18 21:36:41 <Saq>	Or offer to do it automatically
Jul 18 21:36:47 <Saq>	i havent figured it out
Jul 18 21:37:09 <Ace_NoOne>	offer to do it automatically - with an option
Jul 18 21:37:46 <Saq>	Perhaps... ill give it some thought
Jul 18 21:37:54 <Ace_NoOne>	:)
Jul 18 21:38:01 <Saq>	Also right now the timer is global
Jul 18 21:38:12 <Saq>	I am thinking of resetting it each time you start editing a tiddler
Jul 18 21:38:13 <Ace_NoOne>	that's alright I guess
Jul 18 21:38:24 <Saq>	it doesnt make sense to save 5 seconds after you start editing
Jul 18 21:38:30 <Ace_NoOne>	well, true
Jul 18 21:38:33 <Ace_NoOne>	what's the interval?
Jul 18 21:38:37 <Saq>	Just small tweaks
Jul 18 21:38:41 <Saq>	default is 120 seconds
Jul 18 21:38:45 <Saq>	it will be configurable
Jul 18 21:38:52 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: since when do you hide the code
Jul 18 21:38:56 <Saq>	I am working on a Preferences library for plugins now
Jul 18 21:38:59 <Ace_NoOne>	since you started compressing?
Jul 18 21:39:06 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, you said - can't wait for that one
Jul 18 21:39:13 <Saq>	Since the new release.... its not compressed now but will be for the next release
Jul 18 21:39:20 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, figured
Jul 18 21:45:15 <Ace_NoOne>	hmm http://erxz.com/pb/3657
Jul 18 21:47:18 <Ace_NoOne>	hmmm  when I set >> savetimer : 15 << it seems to be saved constantly
Jul 18 21:48:13 <Ace_NoOne>	as soon as I continue typing, the yellow save msg appears - and disappears, and appears, etc.
Jul 18 21:49:01 <Ace_NoOne>	wait, no - if I start typing, it disappears - and re-appears ~1 second after I stop
Jul 18 21:50:04 <Ace_NoOne>	also: "... TiddlyWiki file could be saved:n*[[MainMenu]]n" - syntax error?!
Jul 18 21:50:46 <Ace_NoOne>	that last one might have been me, changing the plugin code - hold on
Jul 18 21:51:04 <Ace_NoOne>	nope, looks vanilla

Jul 19 20:38:25 <Ace_NoOne>	hey Saq
Jul 19 20:38:34 <Ace_NoOne>	y'alright?
Jul 19 20:38:43 <Saq>	yup. Just a busy day.
Jul 19 20:38:58 <Ace_NoOne>	I figured
Jul 19 20:39:02 <Ace_NoOne>	http://devpad.tiddlyspot.com/#PasswordPromptTest%20PasswordPrompt
Jul 19 20:39:10 <Ace_NoOne>	any idea how to make that work in IE?
Jul 19 20:39:28 <Saq>	taking a look
Jul 19 20:39:34 <Ace_NoOne>	IE won't let me do either e.setAttribute("type", "password"); or e.type = "password";)
Jul 19 20:42:20 <Saq>	what happens when you do that?
Jul 19 20:42:31 <Ace_NoOne>	tells me that command was not available or something - hold on
Jul 19 20:43:31 <Ace_NoOne>	yup, this command is not supported
Jul 19 20:43:51 <Ace_NoOne>	slightly different error messages for both variants, but it boils down to the same issue
Jul 19 20:45:13 >seenserv<	seen whiteknight
Jul 19 20:46:03 <Saq>	the setAttribute has to work......
Jul 19 20:46:26 <Ace_NoOne>	it works with other things
Jul 19 20:46:30 <Ace_NoOne>	but not with type / password
Jul 19 20:46:36 <Saq>	go look through BidiX's code.... on the svn
Jul 19 20:46:39 <Saq>	he has done similar stuff
Jul 19 20:46:46 <Ace_NoOne>	oh good idea!
Jul 19 20:46:51 <Ace_NoOne>	speaking of SVN:
Jul 19 20:46:52 <Saq>	for UploadPlugin and for extending the options stuff in general
Jul 19 20:47:05 <Ace_NoOne>	there's a new MW extension that has C-style includes
Jul 19 20:47:13 <Ace_NoOne>	we could pull macro code from SVN with that
Jul 19 20:47:17 <Ace_NoOne>	to mirror macros on the wiki
Jul 19 20:47:22 <Saq>	What good would that do?
Jul 19 20:47:41 <Ace_NoOne>	it would allow us to create a macro library on the wiki without the need for manual updates
Jul 19 20:48:00 <Ace_NoOne>	we could add a short description, category and have the rest pulled from SVN
Jul 19 20:48:05 <Saq>	I think the idea of the library is only to point to the svn. Not to host the plugins.
Jul 19 20:48:18 <Saq>	Not everyone hosts their stuff at svn.tiddlywiki.org
Jul 19 20:48:24 <Ace_NoOne>	I know, that's the limitation
Jul 19 20:49:09 <Ace_NoOne>	I still prefer Daniel's library, but I don't know whether that's moving forward
Jul 19 20:49:14 <Ace_NoOne>	he seems very busy lately
Jul 19 20:49:29 <Saq>	yeah.... he's like that a little.
Jul 19 20:49:39 <Saq>	Learn Ruby and do it for him ;)
Jul 19 20:49:42 <Ace_NoOne>	hah
Jul 19 20:49:46 <Saq>	haha
Jul 19 20:49:49 <Ace_NoOne>	I wish, but ... 
Jul 19 20:49:58 <Saq>	listen buddy... i have to jet again. Good luck with the password stuff.
Jul 19 20:50:02 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks
Jul 19 20:50:03 <Ace_NoOne>	have fun
Jul 19 20:59:52 <Ace_NoOne>	btw Saq: how many books of the Ender Wiggin series did you read? I just started the fifth (Ender's Shadow) yesterday, and it promises to be just as great as the original...
Jul 19 21:00:10 <Saq>	All of them.
Jul 19 21:00:16 <Ace_NoOne>	cool
Jul 19 21:00:29 <Ace_NoOne>	are the ones following Ender's Shadow just as good?

Jul 20 08:31:31 <Ace_NoOne>	good morning
Jul 20 08:31:42 <DanielBaird>	howdy
Jul 20 08:32:21 <Ace_NoOne>	what's new
Jul 20 08:32:57 <Ace_NoOne>	btw Daniel: there now is an extension for MediaWiki that would allow us to pull "live" contents from any online resource - including SVN repos
Jul 20 08:33:32 <Ace_NoOne>	so I was thinking we might use that for inlcuding macros (just add a short description and category, and then include the macro code)
Jul 20 08:42:34 <DanielBaird>	nice idea.. that's kinda what the current plugin library does
Jul 20 08:42:54 <Ace_NoOne>	well, in MW we can't really do fancy parsing tho
Jul 20 08:43:21 <Ace_NoOne>	plus new plugins are not automatically added
Jul 20 08:43:40 <DanielBaird>	ahh.. well maybe the plugin library can make stuffa vailable
Jul 20 08:43:51 <Ace_NoOne>	that's what I thought :D
Jul 20 08:44:07 <Ace_NoOne>	how are you progressing on that?
Jul 20 08:48:30 <DanielBaird>	i haven't had much time lately.  the fetching and basic display for stuff from tw.org svn is working fine; i'm now working on fetching from tiddlywikis like tiddlytools.com etc.
Jul 20 08:48:48 <Ace_NoOne>	cool
Jul 20 08:49:02 <Ace_NoOne>	got a preview set up yet?
Jul 20 08:49:22 <DanielBaird>	used to, it's temporarily broken :)
Jul 20 08:49:27 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe
Jul 20 08:49:32 <DanielBaird>	did you see it before?
Jul 20 08:49:37 <Ace_NoOne>	nope
Jul 20 08:49:44 <Ace_NoOne>	probably haven't been around for long enough

Jul 20 09:17:13 <Saq_>	DanielBaird, you around?
Jul 20 09:32:59 <Saq_>	Ace_NoOne, anyone home?
Jul 20 09:33:05 <Ace_NoOne>	meh
Jul 20 09:33:09 <Ace_NoOne>	just dropped by
Jul 20 09:33:12 <Ace_NoOne>	sup buddy
Jul 20 09:33:17 <Saq_>	Working?
Jul 20 09:33:24 <Ace_NoOne>	sorta ;)
Jul 20 09:33:29 <Saq_>	LOL
Jul 20 09:33:51 <Saq_>	I am looking at the 'PreferenceSaverLib' for plugins...
Jul 20 09:34:04 <Ace_NoOne>	you started on that?
Jul 20 09:34:08 <Saq_>	its difficult to make it very general purpose without making it too complex
Jul 20 09:34:18 <Saq_>	yeah I did im just wondering if im making this too hard.
Jul 20 09:34:31 <Saq_>	This is how you set it up.
Jul 20 09:34:43 <Saq_>	Lets say you have a plugin called TagNavigator ;)
Jul 20 09:34:47 <Ace_NoOne>	ACK!
Jul 20 09:34:49 <Ace_NoOne>	CRUEL!
Jul 20 09:35:04 <Ace_NoOne>	anyways, go on (and straight to hell)
Jul 20 09:35:11 <Saq_>	you create and object called config.TagNavigator.userprefs
Jul 20 09:35:22 <Saq_>	it contains info on the preferences you want to configure
Jul 20 09:35:36 <Saq_>	defaults, what gui to use input, or checkbox or select
Jul 20 09:35:48 <Saq_>	then somewhere in your plugin code, you call:
Jul 20 09:35:58 <Saq_>	SetupPrefs(config.TagNavigator);
Jul 20 09:36:07 <Saq_>	thats it, its setup.
Jul 20 09:36:16 *	DanielBaird has quit ("Leaving.")
Jul 20 09:36:24 <Ace_NoOne>	so the plugin dev has to support it? although, if this would become part of the core...
Jul 20 09:36:39 <Saq_>	later to use the values from within the plugin..... you do this.prefs.get(prefName)
Jul 20 09:36:56 <Saq_>	See thats the thing.... something for the core would have to be a LOT more generic
Jul 20 09:37:21 <Saq_>	I dont really want to do that because I think if they eventually add something for the core it will encompass the cookie options too
Jul 20 09:37:41 <Saq_>	This is mainly meant as a support lib for my plugins
Jul 20 09:37:42 <Ace_NoOne>	hmm
Jul 20 09:37:51 <Ace_NoOne>	let me read through this again
Jul 20 09:38:58 <Ace_NoOne>	so where does the user come in here?
Jul 20 09:39:24 <Saq_>	In your plugin tiddler or wherever you want, you drop a macro
Jul 20 09:39:33 <Saq_>	<<prefs config.myplugin>>
Jul 20 09:39:35 <Saq_>	thats it
Jul 20 09:39:39 <Saq_>	you get a nice table
Jul 20 09:39:46 <Saq_>	give me a minute and ill send you a demo
Jul 20 09:40:14 <Ace_NoOne>	sure
Jul 20 09:40:46 <Ace_NoOne>	but haven't the AdvancedOptions been revamped to provide a similar interface (tho for cookies)
Jul 20 09:40:59 <Saq_>	it was too complicated to reuse that
Jul 20 09:41:12 <Saq_>	thats what I mean.. a solution for the core would hack into that
Jul 20 09:41:22 <Saq_>	but I just want something for my plugins right now
Jul 20 09:41:23 <Ace_NoOne>	oh I see
Jul 20 09:41:27 <Saq_>	relying on the core means waiting
Jul 20 09:41:38 <Saq_>	I want to get this working so I can release my plugins!
Jul 20 09:41:45 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe makes sense
Jul 20 09:42:37 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: I didn't get any further with the IE type="password" issue; BidiX has some PasswordOptionsPlugin which create a new generic type - but I can't figure out where/how the password field is created
Jul 20 09:43:05 <Saq_>	look at the UploadPlugin
Jul 20 09:44:01 <Ace_NoOne>	I did - it uses this PasswordOptionsPlugin (must be new... )
Jul 20 09:44:13 <Saq_>	look at an old copy
Jul 20 09:44:18 <Saq_>	mptw.tiddlyspot.com
Jul 20 09:44:30 <Ace_NoOne>	good idea
Jul 20 09:44:44 <Ace_NoOne>	tho I suppose BidiX just modularized ("outsourced") it...
Jul 20 09:45:08 <Saq_>	it might be easier to figure out
Jul 20 09:45:15 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah checking now
Jul 20 09:45:25 <Saq_>	how big is the password options plugin?
Jul 20 09:45:30 <Saq_>	if not big just require it
Jul 20 09:45:40 <Ace_NoOne>	well, that's the thing
Jul 20 09:45:49 <Saq_>	btw... email!
Jul 20 09:45:55 <Ace_NoOne>	uhm, no!?
Jul 20 09:46:05 <Saq_>	Just sent it
Jul 20 09:46:11 <Ace_NoOne>	ahh
Jul 20 09:46:22 <Ace_NoOne>	since that crypto plugin has different groups with differnet passwords, it'd be a bit odd to use a generic options field maybe
Jul 20 09:46:32 <Saq_>	Look at the PrefsDemo tiddler when you get it
Jul 20 09:46:49 <Saq_>	Ah right.
Jul 20 09:47:00 <Saq_>	Well maybe the code can point you in the right direction
Jul 20 09:47:00 <Ace_NoOne>	you and your console D:
Jul 20 09:47:49 <Saq_>	console rocks
Jul 20 09:47:56 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, I just need to enable FB
Jul 20 09:48:06 <Ace_NoOne>	(I forgot I actually have it installed now... )
Jul 20 09:48:24 <Ace_NoOne>	I like!
Jul 20 09:48:38 <Saq_>	The first "pre" box in the code
Jul 20 09:48:44 <Saq_>	that is what you would have to do in your plugin
Jul 20 09:48:52 <Saq_>	After that is the actual Lib
Jul 20 09:49:02 <Saq_>	Compressed it is 1.8kb
Jul 20 09:49:12 <Saq_>	uncompressed 3kb
Jul 20 09:49:21 <Ace_NoOne>	should be easy - and also "forces" you to have a clear strucute
Jul 20 09:49:23 <Ace_NoOne>	*structure
Jul 20 09:49:24 <Ace_NoOne>	I like
Jul 20 09:49:25 <Saq_>	its not generic enough to become super famous or widely used
Jul 20 09:49:38 <Saq_>	Yeah the forced structure is what I worry about
Jul 20 09:49:43 <Saq_>	is that a bad thing?
Jul 20 09:49:57 <Ace_NoOne>	it's like JSON (or is it JSON? I have no idea)
Jul 20 09:50:02 <Ace_NoOne>	I like structure
Jul 20 09:50:06 <Saq_>	And the macro for the preference you can drop that anywhere you like
Jul 20 09:50:16 <Saq_>	you could have a configuration tiddler for all the plugins
Jul 20 09:50:27 <Saq_>	the LewcidConfigurationCenter
Jul 20 09:50:34 <Ace_NoOne>	hah
Jul 20 09:50:41 <Ace_NoOne>	LCC(tm)
Jul 20 09:50:56 <Saq_>	After I've released all my plugins I can try to make this a little more generic
Jul 20 09:51:01 <Ace_NoOne>	oh my, now you've made me look into JSON
Jul 20 09:51:05 <Saq_>	but for now i want to just use it and get my stuff out there
Jul 20 09:51:11 <Saq_>	oh one thing
Jul 20 09:51:17 <Saq_>	you see the pref called foo1 ?
Jul 20 09:51:19 <Ace_NoOne>	yep
Jul 20 09:51:25 <Saq_>	There are two ways your plugin can access that
Jul 20 09:51:39 <Saq_>	if your code is nice and Object oriented and inside config.myplugin....
Jul 20 09:51:50 <Saq_>	like config.myplugin.handler = function
Jul 20 09:51:53 <Saq_>	then you can do....
Jul 20 09:52:00 <Saq_>	this.pref.get("foo1")
Jul 20 09:52:11 <Saq_>	if you are outside the config.myplugin object.....
Jul 20 09:52:21 <Saq_>	config.myplugin.pref.get("foo1")
Jul 20 09:52:28 <Ace_NoOne>	it's read/write, I assume?
Jul 20 09:52:31 <Saq_>	this encourages a clean OO coding style
Jul 20 09:52:38 <Saq_>	yes there is a set method too
Jul 20 09:52:45 <Ace_NoOne>	cool
Jul 20 09:52:53 <Ace_NoOne>	I don't see how you'd need to make it more generic
Jul 20 09:53:24 <Saq_>	Not sure.... I just dont see it getting more widely used right now
Jul 20 09:53:27 <Ace_NoOne>	this is really quite easy to understand - even someone who doesn't know coding can see the structure (like XML, but less verbose - thus my thinking of JSON)
Jul 20 09:53:53 <Saq_>	there is one more thing involved in setting up a plugin to use this
Jul 20 09:54:00 <Saq_>	after writing the userprefs like that.....
Jul 20 09:54:04 <Saq_>	you need to call one function
Jul 20 09:54:20 <Saq_>	SetupPrefs(config.myplugin,"myplugin");
Jul 20 09:54:23 <Ace_NoOne>	oh my, that's a deal breaker :P
Jul 20 09:54:35 <Saq_>	where config.myplugin is where you put your userprefs
Jul 20 09:54:45 <Saq_>	"myplugin" is the name without the config bit
Jul 20 09:54:52 <Ace_NoOne>	I figured
Jul 20 09:55:00 <Saq_>	Is that too convoluted?
Jul 20 09:55:12 <Ace_NoOne>	if I understand it, everyone will
Jul 20 09:55:20 <Ace_NoOne>	and I do understand (at least I think I do ;) )
Jul 20 09:55:34 <Saq_>	I thought about using the wizard interface... which the AdvancedOptions uses..... but it require more code
Jul 20 09:55:44 <Saq_>	the cool thing is that each plugin reuses the same code
Jul 20 09:55:51 <Saq_>	so all you need is add a Require slice
Jul 20 09:56:00 <Saq_>	to the plugin table 
Jul 20 09:56:09 <Ace_NoOne>	you should consult Jeremy on this; he mentioned in the DateFormats thread that he wanted something like this
Jul 20 09:56:21 <Ace_NoOne>	so it might end up in the core after all, one way or another
Jul 20 09:56:32 <Saq_>	Later... he will want it incorporated with local saving of cookie options
Jul 20 09:56:41 <Ace_NoOne>	?
Jul 20 09:56:51 <Saq_>	That will require more work... right now I want to get the new LewcidTW stuff out there
Jul 20 09:57:02 <Saq_>	right now all the TW options are saved in cookies
Jul 20 09:57:05 <Ace_NoOne>	that's fine - however:
Jul 20 09:57:11 <Ace_NoOne>	I know^^
Jul 20 09:57:43 <Ace_NoOne>	you should make sure to consider the long-term structure - so you don't have to fight with backwards compatibility later on
Jul 20 09:57:53 <Saq_>	One of the things I could have done to make the code much simpler.... would be to save all the prefs in fields in one central tiddler.
Jul 20 09:58:02 <Saq_>	Like "PreferenceDatabaseTiddler"
Jul 20 09:58:11 <Saq_>	instead I have saved them in the tiddler for the plugin itself
Jul 20 09:58:25 <Saq_>	So if you delete the plugin, you automatically delete the preferences
Jul 20 09:58:27 <Saq_>	cleaner
Jul 20 09:58:35 <Ace_NoOne>	good thinking
Jul 20 09:58:43 <Saq_>	well backwards compat wont be a problem if im the only one using this stuff for now :)
Jul 20 09:58:49 <Ace_NoOne>	I hate remnants (Firefox plugins leave those in about:config)
Jul 20 09:58:55 <Ace_NoOne>	true
Jul 20 09:59:08 <Ace_NoOne>	btw: did you get my error report on the CrashGuardPlugin (left a message in here)?
Jul 20 09:59:09 <Saq_>	I'm mostly happy that its under 2k compressed. That is my latest OCD, plugin size
Jul 20 09:59:14 <Saq_>	Yes I did
Jul 20 09:59:21 <Ace_NoOne>	ok good
Jul 20 09:59:24 <Saq_>	it stripped out the \n to n for some reason
Jul 20 09:59:36 <Saq_>	as for the new tiddler not being saved issue..... thats why im sitting on it
Jul 20 09:59:42 <Ace_NoOne>	http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info/#PasswordTweak does not exist anymore D:
Jul 20 09:59:43 <Saq_>	the last one was the 15 second thing....
Jul 20 09:59:54 <Saq_>	if you want to save that often then you deserve problems ;)
Jul 20 10:00:05 <Ace_NoOne>	no 
Jul 20 10:00:17 <Ace_NoOne>	I checked again, and even if I reset to 120 secs, it acts weird
Jul 20 10:00:25 <Saq_>	Like what does it do?
Jul 20 10:00:55 <Ace_NoOne>	hold on
Jul 20 10:02:12 <Ace_NoOne>	hmm
Jul 20 10:02:15 <Ace_NoOne>	can't really replicate it now
Jul 20 10:02:35 <Saq_>	I've tested it quite a bit at 45 seconds and it was fine
Jul 20 10:02:50 <Ace_NoOne>	try testing it with 15 secs, just for a minute or so
Jul 20 10:03:07 <Ace_NoOne>	because people might be paranoid and set it to 5 secs
Jul 20 10:03:17 <Saq_>	I can set a minimum of a minute
Jul 20 10:03:24 <Ace_NoOne>	wait
Jul 20 10:03:30 <Ace_NoOne>	I have it set to 120 secs now
Jul 20 10:03:35 <Saq_>	the point is if you save that often.... there is no way to avoid those problems.
Jul 20 10:03:36 <Ace_NoOne>	but it seems to save like every 12
Jul 20 10:03:47 <Saq_>	bah
Jul 20 10:04:08 <Saq_>	well thanks illl look into it... its not a top priority just now. im distracted with this other stuff!
Jul 20 10:04:13 <Ace_NoOne>	hehe
Jul 20 10:04:20 <Ace_NoOne>	but other than that, it seems to work fine
Jul 20 10:04:48 <Saq_>	so what are you working on now that the skin is done?
Jul 20 10:05:15 <Ace_NoOne>	it's *not* done! in fact, I kinda have the FTS again
Jul 20 10:05:26 <Ace_NoOne>	have hardly done anything on the skin in two days
Jul 20 10:06:31 <Saq_>	Sometimes you just need a break
Jul 20 10:06:47 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, that's what I tell myself too ;)
Jul 20 10:06:56 <Ace_NoOne>	http://pastebin.ca/627339 <-- my running notes / to-do list
Jul 20 10:07:39 <Saq_>	man dont be so fussy
Jul 20 10:07:44 <Saq_>	no one will care except you
Jul 20 10:07:49 <Ace_NoOne>	lol about what
Jul 20 10:07:58 <Saq_>	the small details.
Jul 20 10:07:59 <Ace_NoOne>	also, I'm the only one that counts in that respect
Jul 20 10:08:05 <Saq_>	it looks good... leave it at that!
Jul 20 10:08:29 <Ace_NoOne>	it needs to be *perfect* - which reminds me, I still need to improve code readability in the toolbox section
Jul 20 10:08:55 <Ace_NoOne>	the content styles might be the worst - but then, it might be very easy to pull the stuff from Monobook's CSS
Jul 20 10:09:20 <Saq_>	I just feel sorry for you man.... it doesnt seem like fun any more!
Jul 20 10:09:40 <Ace_NoOne>	hah
Jul 20 10:09:45 <Ace_NoOne>	welcome to my life ;)
Jul 20 10:10:06 <Ace_NoOne>	but honestly, ain't it the same for you and your plugins? think PublisherPlugin
Jul 20 10:10:14 <Saq_>	yes that one!
Jul 20 10:10:21 <Ace_NoOne>	oops - sorry... ;)
Jul 20 10:10:23 <Saq_>	you know what the kicker is???
Jul 20 10:10:28 <Ace_NoOne>	bring it on
Jul 20 10:10:38 <Saq_>	I wrote the first one for a friend that needed to use it for a university presentation
Jul 20 10:10:42 <Saq_>	it was never meant to be re-used
Jul 20 10:10:50 <Ace_NoOne>	lol yeah, I remember - TotS
Jul 20 10:10:54 <Saq_>	i just shared the presentation with the group and now look!!!
Jul 20 10:10:57 <Ace_NoOne>	lol
Jul 20 10:11:07 <Saq_>	Now I feel I have a responsibility to support it
Jul 20 10:11:09 <Ace_NoOne>	but isn't that the most satisfying experience, in a way?
Jul 20 10:11:20 <Ace_NoOne>	heh well, from that perspective...
Jul 20 10:11:22 <Saq_>	the code for the new one is actually done........ but the documentation!!! Lord help me.
Jul 20 10:11:29 <Saq_>	Yeah I guess.
Jul 20 10:11:35 <Ace_NoOne>	is there a lot to document?
Jul 20 10:11:41 <Saq_>	Yes
Jul 20 10:11:44 <Saq_>	Setting it up
Jul 20 10:11:48 <Saq_>	Adding removing modes
Jul 20 10:11:51 <Saq_>	customizing modes
Jul 20 10:12:01 <Ace_NoOne>	you can have more than three modes?
Jul 20 10:12:02 <Saq_>	If I release it without docs ill be flooded with questions
Jul 20 10:12:07 <Saq_>	as many as you like
Jul 20 10:12:10 <Ace_NoOne>	wow!
Jul 20 10:12:30 <Saq_>	Also..... it totally ignores PageTemplate, StyleSheet 
Jul 20 10:12:43 <Saq_>	only uses ModePageTemplate and ModeStyleSheet
Jul 20 10:12:54 <Ace_NoOne>	cool
Jul 20 10:13:03 <Saq_>	that  leaves the standard ones as fallbacks in case you need to start in safe mode or something
Jul 20 10:13:10 <Saq_>	so this stuff needs to be documented
Jul 20 10:13:21 <Ace_NoOne>	well, that should be easy to document if you don't care about fool-proofness:
Jul 20 10:13:30 <Ace_NoOne>	1. create mode, select name (e.g. "foo")
Jul 20 10:13:40 <Ace_NoOne>	2. create PageTemplateFoo
Jul 20 10:13:43 <Saq_>	I like to try and document well enough that no one ever asks a question!
Jul 20 10:13:52 <Ace_NoOne>	that's what MS said...
Jul 20 10:13:57 <Saq_>	lol
Jul 20 10:14:03 <Saq_>	The other problem is that......
Jul 20 10:14:14 <Saq_>	people are used to getting fully configured files for it
Jul 20 10:14:23 <Saq_>	this time I want to only distribute the plugin
Jul 20 10:14:34 <Ace_NoOne>	sounds like a good idea to me - let the community do the rest then
Jul 20 10:14:43 <Saq_>	and then later make public the service I have for assembling a file with your favourite plugins etc
Jul 20 10:14:47 <Ace_NoOne>	you can provide a prefab package later
Jul 20 10:14:53 <Saq_>	Yup.
Jul 20 10:14:58 <Saq_>	Here is the aim now:
Jul 20 10:15:03 <Saq_>	release LewcidTW v2 first
Jul 20 10:15:07 <Saq_>	then publisher plugin
Jul 20 10:15:14 <Saq_>	sometime in the next two weeks, both of them
Jul 20 10:15:21 <Ace_NoOne>	cool
Jul 20 10:15:25 <Saq_>	for LewcidTW v2 I had hoped to finish the redesign first
Jul 20 10:15:28 <Ace_NoOne>	btw, speaking of your plugins:
Jul 20 10:15:37 <Saq_>	But I think I will not wait... redesign can come later
Jul 20 10:15:40 <Ace_NoOne>	did you read my msg about collapsing/expanding lists on hover?
Jul 20 10:15:40 <Saq_>	yes?
Jul 20 10:15:50 <Saq_>	Was there a recent one?
Jul 20 10:15:53 <Ace_NoOne>	hold on
Jul 20 10:16:16 <Ace_NoOne>	Jul 19 10:49:26 <Ace_NoOne>	Saq, about your collapsing/expanding lists plugin: could you make it expand/collapse onmouseover (hover)?
Jul 20 10:16:47 <Ace_NoOne>	I realized that's what I like about my (otherwise crappy) CSS solution: I don't need to click
Jul 20 10:19:42 <Saq_>	yeah its doable.
Jul 20 10:19:51 <Saq_>	hold on, let me add that to the to do
Jul 20 10:19:52 <Ace_NoOne>	don't worry about it tho
Jul 20 10:19:58 <Ace_NoOne>	it's not a major issue
Jul 20 10:20:05 <Ace_NoOne>	something for v1.1 or 1.5
Jul 20 10:20:14 <Saq_>	yup
Jul 20 10:20:17 <Saq_>	not a problem
Jul 20 10:21:03 <Saq_>	Also... with the publisher plugin I want to provide a nice GUI for adding and removing modes.
Jul 20 10:21:40 <Ace_NoOne>	don't go overboard
Jul 20 10:21:46 <Ace_NoOne>	maybe for v2.0
Jul 20 10:22:01 <Saq_>	Well its already coded. Just needs refining.
Jul 20 10:22:07 <Saq_>	Its a table....
Jul 20 10:22:13 <Saq_>	you click and edit the cells
Jul 20 10:22:53 <Ace_NoOne>	nice
Jul 20 10:22:58 <Ace_NoOne>	speaking of that:
Jul 20 10:23:15 <Saq_>	No! No generic table cell editing! Please!
Jul 20 10:23:25 <Ace_NoOne>	lol no
Jul 20 10:23:30 <Saq_>	I have been working hard on resisting that :D
Jul 20 10:23:39 <Saq_>	ok, phew. What then?
Jul 20 10:23:48 <Ace_NoOne>	for my Data Vault, how would I create an interface for adding table rows
Jul 20 10:23:54 <Ace_NoOne>	that is
Jul 20 10:24:00 <Ace_NoOne>	by default I have:
Jul 20 10:24:08 <Ace_NoOne>	|!Username|[...]|
Jul 20 10:24:12 <Ace_NoOne>	|!Password|[...]|
Jul 20 10:24:32 <Saq_>	And you want to add multiple ones?
Jul 20 10:24:38 <Ace_NoOne>	how could I make that a GUI - I know it's possible with some plugin, but I don't know how
Jul 20 10:24:46 <Ace_NoOne>	one row at a time
Jul 20 10:24:55 <Saq_>	So the tiddler content looks like:
Jul 20 10:25:04 <Saq_>	|>|Title|
Jul 20 10:25:15 <Saq_>	|!Username|....|
Jul 20 10:25:25 <Saq_>	|!Password:|,,,|
Jul 20 10:25:27 <Saq_>	right?
Jul 20 10:25:54 <Ace_NoOne>	without the top part
Jul 20 10:25:57 <Ace_NoOne>	the title is the tiddler title
Jul 20 10:25:59 <Ace_NoOne>	BUT
Jul 20 10:26:04 <Ace_NoOne>	I sometimes have
Jul 20 10:26:06 <Ace_NoOne>	!General
Jul 20 10:26:07 <Ace_NoOne>	...
Jul 20 10:26:12 <Ace_NoOne>	!bleh
Jul 20 10:26:14 <Ace_NoOne>	...
Jul 20 10:26:25 <Saq_>	Can I see it? nuke the passwords and show me
Jul 20 10:26:32 <Saq_>	Im a visual person
Jul 20 10:26:32 <Ace_NoOne>	like, for banking: !account info  [... ]  !VISA Card
Jul 20 10:26:37 <Ace_NoOne>	sure, hold on
Jul 20 10:26:37 <Saq_>	Let me feast my eyes on it
Jul 20 10:26:57 <Ace_NoOne>	gimme 5'
Jul 20 10:27:41 <Saq_>	Sure
Jul 20 10:31:34 <Ace_NoOne>	sent
Jul 20 10:31:39 <Ace_NoOne>	pw is "lewcid"
Jul 20 10:31:45 <Saq_>	ok
Jul 20 10:31:47 <Ace_NoOne>	take a look at the Lewcid.org tiddler
Jul 20 10:31:54 <Ace_NoOne>	and click "add record" in the sidebar
Jul 20 10:32:49 <Saq_>	Ah
Jul 20 10:32:55 <Saq_>	So its one table per tiddler
Jul 20 10:33:05 <Saq_>	I thought it was multiple tables per tiddler
Jul 20 10:33:09 <Ace_NoOne>	well, usually it is one
Jul 20 10:33:11 <Ace_NoOne>	but:
Jul 20 10:33:13 <Ace_NoOne>	I forgot
Jul 20 10:33:16 <Ace_NoOne>	lemme pastebin
Jul 20 10:33:17 <Saq_>	No buts :D
Jul 20 10:34:00 <Saq_>	You should share the 'template' for this when you are done
Jul 20 10:34:33 <Ace_NoOne>	http://pastebin.ca/627359
Jul 20 10:34:38 <Ace_NoOne>	I plan to
Jul 20 10:34:44 <Ace_NoOne>	that's why I want to make it fool proof
Jul 20 10:34:56 <Ace_NoOne>	i.e. skip the wiki editing
Jul 20 10:35:00 <Ace_NoOne>	and use forms instead
Jul 20 10:35:04 <Saq_>	The multiple tables complicate things
Jul 20 10:35:21 <Ace_NoOne>	well, that could be alleviated by simple modularizing further
Jul 20 10:35:44 <Saq_>	I would go the hardcore brute force way
Jul 20 10:35:50 <Saq_>	One table per tiddler
Jul 20 10:35:54 <Ace_NoOne>	that's what I mean
Jul 20 10:35:56 <Ace_NoOne>	or
Jul 20 10:35:57 <Saq_>	regexp and split into rows
Jul 20 10:36:02 <Saq_>	split each row into cells
Jul 20 10:36:13 <Saq_>	the plugin adding a row checks to see if it exists
Jul 20 10:36:13 <Ace_NoOne>	I could do as you said before: |>|Title1| ... |>|Title2|
Jul 20 10:36:17 <Saq_>	if it does it replaces it
Jul 20 10:36:24 <Saq_>	if not..... it adds one
Jul 20 10:36:32 <Saq_>	then stitch it back together, save the tiddler
Jul 20 10:36:37 <Ace_NoOne>	I think Dave G has done something similar without custom code - some form something plugin
Jul 20 10:36:52 <Saq_>	Ace_NoOne, thats a heavier implementation
Jul 20 10:36:53 <Ace_NoOne>	not sure if he actually dynamically adds fields tho
Jul 20 10:36:58 <Ace_NoOne>	?
Jul 20 10:37:05 <Saq_>	Its a huge ass plugin
Jul 20 10:37:09 <Ace_NoOne>	which one
Jul 20 10:37:10 <Saq_>	write custom code
Jul 20 10:37:19 <Saq_>	Form Tiddler + Data Tiddler
Jul 20 10:37:34 <Ace_NoOne>	ah, that's the names I was looking for - but you say it's not worth it?
Jul 20 10:37:46 <Saq_>	It could be as simple as having an input field at the bottom of the tiddler
Jul 20 10:37:49 <Saq_>	with an add button
Jul 20 10:37:56 <Saq_>	type in the stuff you need and click add
Jul 20 10:37:59 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 20 10:38:03 <Ace_NoOne>	appending should be easy
Jul 20 10:38:06 <Saq_>	you are looking at maybe 3-4kb of code
Jul 20 10:38:10 <Saq_>	at the very very most
Jul 20 10:38:13 <Saq_>	probably less
Jul 20 10:38:22 <Ace_NoOne>	ok, I'll add it to my ToDo list
Jul 20 10:38:27 <Saq_>	I do something similar for the MultiRssConfig
Jul 20 10:38:35 <Saq_>	but the reading not the adding
Jul 20 10:38:39 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah
Jul 20 10:38:43 <Ace_NoOne>	btw, speaking of reading:
Jul 20 10:38:50 <Saq_>	remember the configuration options I mentioned for the publisher plugin?
Jul 20 10:38:53 <Ace_NoOne>	you said tiddler slices don't support tables
Jul 20 10:38:55 <Saq_>	it does the exact same thing really
Jul 20 10:39:02 <Saq_>	I did? When?
Jul 20 10:39:15 <Ace_NoOne>	well, you said it didn't extract data from tables, IIRC that is
Jul 20 10:39:26 <Saq_>	but it does
Jul 20 10:39:31 <Saq_>	like the plugin info
Jul 20 10:39:41 <Ace_NoOne>	exactly - and the new systemServer (bookmark) tiddlers
Jul 20 10:39:49 <Ace_NoOne>	I must have misunderstood you then
Jul 20 10:39:51 <Saq_>	http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlerSlicing
Jul 20 10:40:04 <Saq_>	Im really happy I didnt have to write the regexp for that!
Jul 20 10:40:08 <Ace_NoOne>	because before I used these tables for records, I had tiddler: slice
Jul 20 10:40:10 <Ace_NoOne>	lol
Jul 20 10:40:32 <Saq_>	look at the stuff it supports and you will understand!
Jul 20 10:40:38 <Ace_NoOne>	I just did :)
Jul 20 10:41:55 <Ace_NoOne>	for this plugin, I would modify the ViewTemplate by adding something like <input type="text"> <input type="button"> - right?
Jul 20 10:42:07 <Saq_>	No
Jul 20 10:42:14 <Saq_>	Write a macro that creates the inputs
Jul 20 10:42:22 <Saq_>	just add the macro to the ViewTemplate
Jul 20 10:42:24 <Saq_>	easier
Jul 20 10:42:27 <Ace_NoOne>	true
Jul 20 10:42:30 <Ace_NoOne>	but D: what about removing rows - that might be a pain
Jul 20 10:42:35 <Saq_>	Nope
Jul 20 10:42:50 <Saq_>	Read it in as a hashmap
Jul 20 10:42:52 <Saq_>	wait
Jul 20 10:43:53 <Saq_>	http://pastebin.com/m72682af
Jul 20 10:44:08 <Saq_>	the first line in the function
Jul 20 10:44:16 <Saq_>	you would do store.getTiddlerText instead
Jul 20 10:44:19 <Saq_>	the rest is the same
Jul 20 10:44:29 <Saq_>	so you get a hashmap. You an refer to each row by name
Jul 20 10:44:46 <Ace_NoOne>	cool - thanks!
Jul 20 10:44:53 <Saq_>	in the last line
Jul 20 10:45:05 <Saq_>	I have three cells in each row
Jul 20 10:45:12 <Saq_>	thats why it looks that way
Jul 20 10:45:16 <Saq_>	your last line would be
Jul 20 10:45:22 <Ace_NoOne>	 brb
Jul 20 10:45:30 <Saq_>	modes[modesparts[1]] = modeparts[2]
Jul 20 10:45:50 <Saq_>	then modes["password"] would give you the password
Jul 20 10:45:55 <Saq_>	to delete 
Jul 20 10:46:08 <Saq_>	delete modes["password"];
Jul 20 10:46:11 <Saq_>	to replace 
Jul 20 10:46:20 <Saq_>	modes["password"] = new value
Jul 20 10:46:22 <Saq_>	to add
Jul 20 10:46:31 <Saq_>	modes["password'] = value
Jul 20 10:46:50 <Saq_>	then you stitch it back with a join() call and save the tiddler
Jul 20 10:47:32 <Ace_NoOne>	wow
Jul 20 10:47:39 <Ace_NoOne>	you pretty much did this for me already
Jul 20 10:47:43 <Saq_>	hehe
Jul 20 10:47:49 <Saq_>	I told you its easy
Jul 20 10:48:00 <Ace_NoOne>	I will need to save this log...
Jul 20 10:48:03 <Saq_>	remember the json structure you were admiring earlier?
Jul 20 10:48:12 <Saq_>	you are creating one on the fly
Jul 20 10:48:13 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah (was it indeed JSON?)
Jul 20 10:48:16 <Saq_>	yup
Jul 20 10:48:37 <Ace_NoOne>	so there's not much to learn about JSON? other than lvl1.lvl2 ?
Jul 20 10:48:45 <Saq_>	for saving its easy.
Jul 20 10:48:50 <Saq_>	No there really isnt
Jul 20 10:49:01 <Saq_>	saving is........
Jul 20 10:49:18 <Saq_>	a for loop over mode parts
Jul 20 10:49:33 <Ace_NoOne>	huh?
Jul 20 10:49:38 <Saq_>	wait
Jul 20 10:49:41 <Ace_NoOne>	oh ok
Jul 20 10:49:44 <Saq_>	let me write you some code
Jul 20 10:50:09 <Ace_NoOne>	ack I wish TW table syntax supported cell classes
Jul 20 10:52:16 <Saq_>	http://pastebin.com/m560be15c
Jul 20 10:52:18 <Saq_>	very raw
Jul 20 10:52:23 <Saq_>	but you will get the idea
Jul 20 10:52:30 <Saq_>	thats the code for saving it back
Jul 20 10:52:43 <Ace_NoOne>	when will those pastebins expire?
Jul 20 10:52:48 <Ace_NoOne>	(because of the logs)
Jul 20 10:52:51 <Saq_>	I have no clue
Jul 20 10:52:57 <Saq_>	I've never used pastebin before
Jul 20 10:53:02 <Ace_NoOne>	ok, I'll repost then
Jul 20 10:53:05 <Saq_>	save them if you like.
Jul 20 10:53:17 <Saq_>	I chose a month
Jul 20 10:53:19 <Saq_>	to remember it
Jul 20 10:53:49 <Saq_>	you code is pretty much written
Jul 20 10:53:55 <Ace_NoOne>	yeah, I can see that lol
Jul 20 10:53:56 <Saq_>	except the multiple tables per tiddler
Jul 20 10:53:57 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks so much
Jul 20 10:53:59 <Saq_>	:)
Jul 20 10:54:01 <Saq_>	no worries
Jul 20 10:54:14 <Ace_NoOne>	http://pastebin.ca/627366 <-- reposted (for my own reference)
Jul 20 10:54:41 <Ace_NoOne>	multiple tables are now obsolte; I've switched to this:
Jul 20 10:54:43 <Saq_>	the first function is your load function
Jul 20 10:54:46 <Ace_NoOne>	|>|text-align: center;background-color:#eee;color:#999;!section|
Jul 20 10:54:51 <Saq_>	the second code  is your save function
Jul 20 10:55:00 <Ace_NoOne>	yup
Jul 20 10:55:19 <Ace_NoOne>	^^ that's why I wish cell classes were supported - a lot of redundancy
Jul 20 10:56:08 <Ace_NoOne>	actually, I might look into that sometime
Jul 20 10:56:18 <Ace_NoOne>	should be easy to add something like this:
Jul 20 10:56:28 <Ace_NoOne>	|@@class@@contents|
Jul 20 10:56:51 <Saq_>	http://pastebin.ca/627369
Jul 20 10:58:05 <Ace_NoOne>	http://pastebin.ca/627373 <-- comprised here
Jul 20 10:58:24 <Saq_>	just ask if you need help
Jul 20 10:58:30 <Saq_>	it should be quite simple
Jul 20 10:58:32 <Ace_NoOne>	will do - I might tackle this tonight
Jul 20 10:59:03 <Saq_>	you want your macro to to produce two inputs
Jul 20 10:59:08 <Saq_>	one for name and one for value
Jul 20 10:59:09 <Ace_NoOne>	should be simple to add a checkbox too, to determine whether to use a title cell (as pasted above)
Jul 20 10:59:14 <Saq_>	perhaps in a nice table
Jul 20 10:59:19 <Saq_>	yup
Jul 20 10:59:39 <Saq_>	on loading the regexp can look for it
Jul 20 10:59:44 <Saq_>	use the ! to pick it up
Jul 20 10:59:52 <Ace_NoOne>	look for what?
Jul 20 10:59:59 <Saq_>	the title cell
Jul 20 11:00:11 <Saq_>	so it doesnt include it in the json hashmap
Jul 20 11:00:20 <Ace_NoOne>	oh right
Jul 20 11:00:27 <Saq_>	Fred... stop thinking
Jul 20 11:00:29 <Saq_>	just code
Jul 20 11:00:33 <Saq_>	its easier
Jul 20 11:00:35 <Ace_NoOne>	nah, needs more studying
Jul 20 11:00:40 <Saq_>	no!!!
Jul 20 11:00:43 <Ace_NoOne>	lol!
Jul 20 11:00:45 <Saq_>	thats your problem
Jul 20 11:00:51 <Saq_>	you study things to death
Jul 20 11:00:58 <Ace_NoOne>	studying as in exam next week
Jul 20 11:01:01 <Saq_>	when you are learning its better to code and learn
Jul 20 11:01:02 <Ace_NoOne>	not as in preparation
Jul 20 11:01:02 <Saq_>	ah!
Jul 20 11:01:03 <Saq_>	right
Jul 20 11:01:07 <Saq_>	yes gooo
Jul 20 11:01:08 <Ace_NoOne>	I will code this tonight
Jul 20 11:01:16 <Ace_NoOne>	well, more like compile than code ;)
Jul 20 11:01:19 <Saq_>	study man
Jul 20 11:01:19 <Saq_>	I wish I could kick you off the channel!
Jul 20 11:01:27 <Ace_NoOne>	well, go and register the channel then
Jul 20 11:01:35 <Ace_NoOne>	but you're right - I should go
Jul 20 11:01:41 <Saq_>	later man!
Jul 20 11:01:43 <Ace_NoOne>	thanks for this, I really appreciate it
Jul 20 11:01:47 <Saq_>	No problem
Jul 20 11:01:55 <Ace_NoOne>	*poof
Jul 20 11:01:56 <Ace_NoOne>	*
